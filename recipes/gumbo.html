    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Authentic New Orleans Gumbo is made with a dark roux, vegetables,
      chicken, sausage, and shrimp, and served over rice. This is a beloved
      recipe shared with me by a native New Orleanian.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 cup of dark roux</li>
      <li> 1-2 large onions</li>
      <li>1 lbshrimp</li>
      <li>crab legs</li>
      <li>1 lb smoked sausage</li>
      <li>gumbo filè</li>
      <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice onions. Slice sausage. Peel/devein shrimp. Pick crab meat if needed. Measure your roux, stock and filé. Have rice ready or start it shortly before serving.</li>
        <li>In a large, heavy pot (Dutch oven), heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high. Add the sliced smoked sausage and brown lightly to render flavor — 4–6 minutes. Remove about half the sausage to a plate (you can leave some in for flavor). Leave the browned bits and any fat in the pot.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. If your roux is cold/stored, add it to the pot and warm it gently, stirring to incorporate with the sausage fat. If your roux is very hot, be careful — it splatters. (If you made the roux in the same pot, you’re already set.)</li>
        <li>Add the diced onions to the roux and sauté, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant (they’ll “bloom” in the roux). For classic gumbo you’d also add bell pepper & celery here (holy trinity) if available.</li>
        <li>Slowly add 1–2 cups of stock while stirring or whisking to loosen the roux and create a smooth base. Continue adding the remaining stock a little at a time until you reach a nice soupy consistency (total 4–6 cups). Scrape up any browned bits.</li>
        <li>Return the browned sausage to the pot. Add 1–2 bay leaves, ½–1 tsp salt (to taste), and black pepper; add a pinch of cayenne if you like heat. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook 20–30 minutes so flavors meld. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add the crab meat near the end of the simmer — crab is delicate and you only need to heat it through so it doesn’t break up too much. Simmer gently 5–8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp last and simmer until just pink and opaque — usually 2–4 minutes depending on size. Do not overcook shrimp or they’ll be rubbery.</li>
        <li>Remove from direct heat and sprinkle gumbo filé powder into the pot gradually (or add filé at the bowl level when serving). Stir and taste. Filé thickens slightly and adds that characteristic sassafras flavor — do not boil after adding filé (boiling makes it stringy).</li>
        <li>Spoon hot cooked white rice into bowls, ladle gumbo over the rice, then allow each diner to add a final pinch of filé (optional). Garnish with chopped green onions or parsley if you have them.</li>
