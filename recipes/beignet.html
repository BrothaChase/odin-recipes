    <h2>Dscription</h2>
    <p>Want to celebrate Mardi Gras from the comfort of your kitchen? Make beignets. Liberally dusted in confectioners’ sugar, these pillowy deep-fried doughnuts will transport you to Bourbon Street in just one bite.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups of whole milk, warmed to 110°</li>
        <li>4 Tbps granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp. active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooked</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying and greasing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In the large bowl of a stand mixer, whisk 1/2 cup milk and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar until combined. Sprinkle yeast over and let sit until foamy and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk yeast mixture to combine, then add egg, butter, and remaining 3/4 cup milk and 3 tablespoons granulated sugar. Whisk until incorporated. Add flour and salt, then place bowl in base of stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Beat on low speed until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until stretchy and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil. Gather dough into a rough ball and place in bowl. Turn once so oiled side is facing up. Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, making sure it doesn’t touch dough. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, turn out dough. Using a rolling pin, roll out dough, dusting top with flour if it sticks, to a rectangle about 12" x 10" and 1/4" thick. Using a sharp knife, cut dough into 30 (2") squares.</li>
        <li>Into a large Dutch oven or heavy pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, pour oil to a depth of 3". Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 350°. Place a wire rack inside a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Working 4 or 5 at a time, lower dough squares into hot oil. Fry, turning occasionally and adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature between 350° to 360°, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Using a large slotted spoon or spider, transfer beignets to prepared</li>
        <li>Transfer beignets to a platter. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
