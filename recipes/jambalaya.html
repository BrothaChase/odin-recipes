    <h2>Description</h2>
    This NOLA jambalaya recipe is a quick and painless one-pot meal that’ll feed
    everyone at your dinner table — and then some! Bursting with diced
    vegetables and three kinds of protein, it’s a perfectly spiced Creole dish
    featuring all the best creole flavors from New Orleans.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Shrimp</li>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Smoked sausage</li>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Diced vegetables</li>
      <li>
        White onions (can throw in green onions if you want for good measure)
      </li>
      <li>Bell peppers</li>
      <li>Celery</li>
      <li>Crushed Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Creole Seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Sear Sauasge:</strong> In a large saucepan or stockpot for all
        ingredients, sear the sausage on medium heat, browning on both sides.
        Transfer to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare Roux & Diced vegetables:</strong> Add the flour to the pan
        and stir until lightly browned. Now, add the diced vegetables and garlic
        and continue stirring for several minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add meat and tomatoes:</strong> Add the raw chicken and cooked
        sausage to the pan. Stir into the vegetables before adding the tomatoes,
        Creole seasoning, thyme, and oregano. Stir everything together and bring
        to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Rice:</strong> Pour the uncooked rice into the pan and stir.
        Season with salt and pepper, then add water or broth as needed to reach
        desired consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simmer & Add Shrimp:</strong> Reduce the heat and simmer for 25
        minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the shrimp and simmer for another 10
        minutes until the shrimp are pink and the sauce thickens — it will still
        be slightly soupy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Dish this up while still warm, dividing into bowls
        and garnishing with green onions.
      </li>
    </ol>
